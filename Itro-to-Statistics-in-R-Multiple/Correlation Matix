# Step 1:row vector of sums

# The raw dataframe X is already loaded in.
X

# Construction of 1 by 10 matrix I of which the elements are all 1
I <- matrix(1, nrow = 1, ncol = 10)

# Compute the row vector of sums
t_mat <- I %*% X

# Step 2: Row vector of means and matrix of means

# The data matrix `X` and the row vector of sums (`t_mat`) are saved and can be used.

# Number of observations
n = 10

# Compute the row vector of means
M <- 0.1 * t_mat

# Construction of 10 by 1 matrix J of which the elements are all 1
J <- matrix(1, nrow=10, ncol=1)

# Compute the matrix of means
MM <- J %*% M

# Step 3: Matrix of deviation scores


# Matrix of deviation scores D
D <- X - MM

# Step 4: Sum of squares and sum of cross products matrix

# Sum of squares and sum of cross products matrix
S <- t(D) %*% D

# Step 5: Calculating the correlation matrix

# The previously generated matrices X, M, MM, D and S do not need to be constructed again but are saved and can be used.
n = 10

# Construct the variance-covariance matrix
C <- S * (1/n)

# Generate the standard deviations matrix
SD <- diag(x = diag(C)^(1/2), nrow = 3, ncol = 3)

# Compute the correlation matrix
R <- solve(SD) %*% C  %*% solve(SD)
