# fs is available in your working environment

# Create the dummy variables

# Merge the dataset in an extended dataframe
extended_fs <- cbind(dept_code, fs)

# Look at the extended dataframe

# Provide summary statistics

# Regress salary against years and publications

# Apply the summary function to get summarized results for model

# Compute the confidence intervals for model

# Create dummies for the categorical variable fs$dept by using the C() function
